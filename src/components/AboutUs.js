        <h1>About Us </h1>
        As engineering college students, we have come to realize that possessing theoretical knowledge alone is insufficient to achieve our aspirations. It is imperative to acknowledge that time management presents a formidable challenge within our university, given the constant barrage of tests and assignments.

Our initiative initially aimed to offer students access to previous years' question papers across all subjects within the School of Engineering. This provision serves to enhance exam preparation. Moreover, we have plans to expand our services to encompass other academic departments in the future.

In addition, we endeavor to provide an array of essential resources for assignments and foster the development of supplementary skills necessary for academic researchers and individuals seeking industrial expertise.
